I opened my 1E (hex) old folders and i realized something ... i had exactly 1010 (bin) unread messages !? Then i found a photo of my friend   '   George   '  which made me smile , because we had such a nice (up, 2) trip to athens (cap) back in the day. A honest mistake happened though : someone wrote a very WEird sentence (low) right under it. I tried to fix it but i was thinking ... maybe i should write a, helpful note instead. As the main character used to say , ' take care ' !
